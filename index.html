        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>I am a singer, songwriter and composer from India (Ludhiana, Punjab). I've been singing since I was a kid but I got into music properly when I was 16, this was the time when I started learning the guitar.</p>
            <p> It all started with a band in my school. When I saw the guitarist performing, I immediately knew this was something I wanted to do in the future and gladly since then, there has been no turning back.</p>
            <p>In each one of my songs, I try to tell a story. I try that the songs make you fall in love, make you long for something that you haven't ever felt. I hope you feel things from my perspective.</p>
